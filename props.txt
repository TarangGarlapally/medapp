USER PERSPECTIVE : 

1.         user registration : 
	this is the first page to appear in the App 
	this page contains a simple User registration. 
	it has a logo and Entries {username and Pass}  and  Signup/Signin  buttons 
                        
	** the User must Register with the Mobile number which is registered in the Recent hospital 
	we just alert the User by saying that he would get the Request and able to select the hospital he's in through the Registered mobile Number
2.     User and the Hospital Connectivity : 
	Once the User gets registered he will 
	be  having 2 options 
                                    1.informed that the first visit in any hospital will 
		be Linked to the User. 
	            2. User will be able to accept the Request sent by the Hospitals. 
3.    Digital Prescription : 
	here we have considered a particular format for prescription and we store the data in the db accordingly. 
	we need not take the basic attributes { name , age } as inputs we take Other attr like medicine name , nPills , weight, height {if weight and height 	are measured}. 
	Each and every prescription has a uniq id and is linked to the User. 
4.    Medication Plan : 
	the Medication Plan contains Manily Three Stages { morning , afternoon , eve} 
	so based on how the Latest prescription is Updated we decide the Medication Plan. 
	and based on the issuse the User is facing with We recommend him doing excersice , recommend movies for metal growth. 
5.  User Schemas : 
	We maintain a list of  Schema that are or will be implemented by the Governement which are related to the paitients and 
	apply them accordingly. 
6. Health Rate : 
	Based on the User Health { each month } we decide the Health Rate of the User 
	{ here for now we are considering some basic attributes for the estimation of Health Rate 
		i.e   body temp ,  basic{ cough , sneezes , allergy } } 
	for now we are giving the credentials to the doctors the Update the data of the User but Our main goal is to link the 
	machinery which automatically Updates the User's data.

Doctor Registration : 
{ I think for Now we are going to create a psuedo db that has set of Doctors{ not Organisations } and link the Users to Them }.
